# Public Repository of Better-Fleet_Control of HackaTum-2024

This is the public repository that has no api keys or other privat information.
It has a custom simulation, simulating the problem set.

The purpose of this repository is not in getting the code running, but getting a quick idea of what we did.
Code is also messy, its a hackathon :)
